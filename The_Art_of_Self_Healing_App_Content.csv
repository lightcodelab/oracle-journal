TAoSH-1-8,1,"If you suck at visualisation, experiment with me. Over the years, I have found 25% of people say they can’t visualise. In fact, 24% can – they just don’t realise they are visualising. The other 1% have a medical condition which prevents them from visualising, but they can feel. Feeling is the next best way to communicate with your body.


","Exercise: Access Memory
Sit in your lounge room. Now describe your bedroom. Write down all the things you can recall about your room. For example, you may have a chest of drawers, a walk-in robe, an ensuite, a feather doona, glass doors onto a balcony and a pot plant in the right hand corner of the room.

If you don’t look through the door of your bedroom, how can you write down so many details about your room? 

Well the answer is you remember what it looks like. You access the memory faculty of your mind and you either just know, or you literally see a vision of your room and you are able to recall it similar to when you watch a movie. This is the same faculty you need to use for creative and spontaneous visualisation.

With spontaneous visualisation you won’t have a memory you can access. It just runs like a “new movie” in this faculty. With creative visualisation you can either change a memory or alter the “new movie”. 

For example, let’s go back to your bedroom; you could change the doona cover to be black and red (something that you’ve never seen before). You can creatively change your bedroom in this dimension. The creative aspect is when you decide you will change the doona cover and the spontaneous aspect is when the cover pops into your vision and it is something you’ve never seen before. ",
TAoSH-2-8,2,,"Exercise: Balance Emotions With the Breath
• To perform this simple technique it’s best to be sitting comfortably either in a meditation pose or on a chair with your feet flat on the floor.

• Become conscious of your breath. Focus on a point at the front of your nose and your top lip.

• While doing this:-
- to the count of 10, breathe steadily in filling your entire lungs; and
- to the count of 10, steadily release the breath all the way out, completely emptying your lungs

• Continue this process for 5 minutes.

• This simple breathing technique will balance your emotions. With practice, you will manage out of control emotional outbursts calmly, and effectively deal with day to day challenges.

• By practicing this technique each day for five minutes you will transform every area of your life for the better.",
TAoSH-3-8,3,"Bowel (Metaphysical Body Language)
We have the small intestine (bowel) and the large intestine (bowel).

The small intestine supports us nutritionally and the large bowel removes the waste. It depends on where the problem is in the bowel as to what message you are being given.

A problem in the small bowel is a sign your soul is not receiving the nutrition it needs – this could be because you are literally not feeding your soul, or you can’t absorb or understand what you are feeding it.

A problem in the large bowel is a sign of holding on (in the case of constipation) and with diarrhea which can be swift and sudden indicates not absorbing all the information needed.","Exercise: Bowel Healing Elixir
• A great healing elixir for the bowel is to imagine a royal blue ball of light (about the size of a golf ball), put it into your mouth and swallow it.

• Imagine you are made of glass and watch the ball of light slide down your oesophagus, whiz around your stomach, down into the duodenum, into the small intestine (looks like a bunch of hairpin bends in a road), up the large intestine on the right, over the top of the abdomen and down the left side, through the colon and out the anus.

Do this from the perspective of being associated with your body. What this means is you are observing the blue ball of light from inside your body, not witnessing it in your holographic body in your screen of mind.

The secret to getting the best out of this exercise is when an outside thought comes (ie., other than travelling from mouth to anus) go back to the beginning and start again. With practice this exercise will help you have control of the tension in your bowel. I use it to manage IBS spasms. It also helps you have control over peristalsis which helps with reducing constipation. It also helps to move diarrhea through your gut quickly.",
TAoSH-4-8,4,"Meditation
This meditation can help to rejuvenate and refill your inner reservoir. As you become accustomed to the process you can increase the length of time you meditate. Although, don’t turn it into just another task to do, as you will lose the magic of the process.","Exercise: Breath meditation
• Simply focus on your breath in and your breath out.

• Observe how your nostrils feel as the air is drawn gently through your nose and down the back of your throat into your lungs. As your breath gently flows out of your lungs, up the back of your throat and out through your nose become aware of the hairs on your top lip. What happens when you breathe out?

• Repeat for 5 minutes.",
TAoSH-5-8,5,"Meditation
Meditation is a great discipline to have. If you are not doing so already start the habit of meditating regularly. Seasoned meditators will meditate for an hour or more per day. However, if you are just starting out this may be too much for you.","Exercise: Candle meditation
• Focus your attention on a candle flame. For this meditation you need to be sitting and remain open-eyed. However, if your eyes spontaneously close, don’t force them to remain open.

• If your mind wanders – that’s fine – bring it back to the candle when you observe it has become distracted. Once again, focus on the flame.

• Start doing this meditation for 5 minutes and increase the time as you feel moved to.",
TAoSH-6-8,6,,"Exercise: Cleansing Your Home
You will need a white house candle – just the normal candle that you keep in the cupboard for a power blackout is best.

Wrap about 15cm (6in) of alfoil around the bottom of the candle, creating an alfoil cup to catch any dripping wax. Light your candle. You will do this ritual in your entire house, going into every corner of every room and over the furniture.

With medium speed, raise the candle up towards the ceiling as far as your arm will go and back down again. As you do this, say this mantra:

“I cleanse this room in God’s light.”

If black smoke comes off the candle repeat the process in this particular spot until no black smoke comes off the candle. The black smoke leaves evidence on the white candle in the form of black or grey wax dripping down the side of the candle.

TAoSH-7-8,7,"
","Exercise: Cleansing Your Work Environment
You can use crystals to cleanse your work environment. If you do this, it is important to also cleanse your crystals regularly. 

It has been scientifically proven that having a plant on your desk or close to your work environment will also impact on you in a positive way.

“No matter how token, plants are the ambassadors of friendliness; they enable an ambience that is not controlled, robotic, confined – instead by having nature inside, the impression is created of a calm,
open, homelike experience.

It is not just the aesthetic or psychological impressions that plants make but how plants scientifically put a person at ease that add value to interior plantscaping. Green triggers a response in the sympathetic nervous system to relieve tension in the blood vessels and thus lower the blood pressure, green lowers heart rate and provides an instant feeling of rest and recovery.

Dr. Billy C. Wolverton from the John C. Stennis Space Centre recommends for optimum employee health benefit, placing a plant on one’s desk, or within six to eight cubic feet of where most of the person’s daily activity occurs.”

Source: Interior landscaping in the workplace, benefits to business - Fiann Ó Nualláin

In light of this research, if you work in an office, and don’t have a plant, I recommend you buy one to put on your desk. Do your own experiment. This is Fiann’s list of top 10 plants for the office:

1. Kentia Palm
2. Spathiphyllum spp (peacelily)
3. Chlorophytum spp (spiderplant)
4. Philodendron spp
5. Dracaena spp
6. Ficus spp
7. Scindapsus/Epipremnun
8. Hedra helix (ivy)
9. Syngonium spp
10. Sansevieria spp (snakeplant)",
TAoSH-8-8,8,"What is Creative Visualisation?
“Creative visualisation” is the type of visualisation that occurs when you consciously or actively manipulate, change or deliberately invent what you see in your imagination during meditation or when you ponder something.

With creative visualisation you transform your imagination like an artist changes or enhances a painting.","Exercise: Creative Visualisation
• Imagine you are inside of a shell (it can look like whatever you imagine) and deliberately (use your creative mind) add a bench in the centre of the shell and sit on it.

• As you imagine yourself sitting there, ask your guide to come into your visualisation. 

These added elements are creative visualisation. When the guide arrives, this could be spontaneous as you may not have seen this guide before. If you know what your guide looks like, you can manifest them in this vision and that would be creative visualisation.",
TAoSH-9-8,9,"How do you locate your physical intuition signal?
Observe your body. Become conscious of the subtle things happening in or on your body and around you. Look for a signal that happens regularly. Once you recognise the signal, you’ll know when your intuition is delivering you information.

You can either take note or ignore it – the choice is yours.","Exercise: Discover Your Tangible Sign For Intuition
Some examples of a physical sensation or tangible sign are:

• goosebumps
• the hairs on the back of your neck stand up
• tingling in a certain part of your body
• a sensation in your solar plexus

There are many more that are unique to individuals. Locate your physical sensation if you haven’t done this already.",
TAoSH-10-8,10,,"Exercise: Keep an emotion journal
If you are on a personal or spiritual growth path, at the end of each day take time to reflect. Reflect on your emotions throughout the day and what influenced or triggered them. Reflect on your behaviour and learnings; and this will help you to recognise any patterns you keep doing or give you an opportunity to decide they no longer serve you and stop doing them. 

When reflecting and journalling, sometimes you will discover things about yourself that you don’t like and other times you'll find things you are grateful, proud and in awe of during the process of self-understanding.

Keep a note of everything.",
TAoSH-11-8,11,"How to turn your Empath Gift On and Off
Over recent years, I’ve been hearing more and more people describe their empath ability as a curse. They want to know how to turn it off. 

Humans are like radio receivers as well as radio transmitters and it’s the receiving element that sometimes needs to be tuned out. ","Exercise: Empath Radio Dial
• Take the time to imagine the dial of an old radio. If you are an empath it is likely your dial will be continually roaming and tuning into the closest frequency, giving you no rest and respite from the thoughts and feelings of others.

• Turn the dial to static and lock it in. You can turn it down eg., from 10 to 1, or turn it hard to the left or right and lock it in by pushing the dial into the radio or pulling it out till it clicks. When you want to be empathic release the dial back to free movement and allow it to scan frequencies again.

• I’ve shared the concept here, now you can transform the concept into your version of the “Radio Dial”. The more creative you are the more profound the impact will be on all your bodies.",
TAoSH-12-8,12,"Eyes
The eyes are our seeing faculty. When there is a problem with the eyes, this indicates a blockage with seeing all that is available. Our internal filters can hide vital information from us. Eyes that experience difficulty are a signal for you to look deeper into what you are not seeing.

This is also significant when your inner sight appears to be blocked. Look at the underlying emotions and you will locate where you need to spend some time.

People who are blind or vision impaired can participate and examine this symbolism and contemplate the question – “What is it I am not seeing?” ","Exercise: Eye Balm
• Sit in a peaceful, quiet place.

• Close your eyes and place the palms of your hands over your eyes.

• Imagine coming from your palms is a beautiful, soothing, healing light penetrating into the depths of your eyes and going deeper into your inner third eye.

• Feel your eyes being bathed in this light for 5 minutes.",
TAoSH-13-8,13,"Be Authentic
What do I mean by authentic? Simply put, discover who you are and live true to yourself? In other words – walk your talk.

Do you know your core values? The following activity can help you to find out what your core values are. (Hoople, 2012)

When you live by your core values, people can feel this and they trust you at a deep level without even understanding why. We communicate in many different ways – speech, facial expression, body language, thoughts, feelings, belief systems – you can feel all of these about another person.

“Do you live by your core values?”

If your answer is yes – awesome! Keep it up!

If your answer is no – then you can start today! It’s never too late to start.

When you live your life by your core values your passion and purpose illuminates you from within. Your body moves in flow, you glow with vitality and your wisdom is clear for all to see, feel and hear.","Exercise: Find Your Core Values
• Write down 20 values that really resonate with you.

• Narrow down those 20 values to the 10 most important.

• Narrow down those 10 values to the 5 most important.

• Decide their order of importance. Determine which of the 5 is least important and keep going to the most important.

• Do some creative journaling/brainstorming with your 5 most important core values. Write down and possibly illustrate what each of those values means to you. “Beauty” might mean:

- having an attractive personal appearance to one person
- surrounding oneself with beauty to another
- maybe creating beauty to someone else
- or it might mean all of the above

• Return to your list of core values whenever you’re making a decision. Ask yourself: “Is this in line with my 5 most important values?”",
TAoSH-14-8,14,"We all have the solution to our problems, we just need the space to verbalise and work through it. 

Don't verbally vomit all over someone and walk away feeling better. If you do this you won’t have a friend/confidante for very long and also you run a high risk of initiating a tight downward spiral of emotion that sucks both of you into the whirlpool. No benefit is gained for you and you’ve contaminated your friend/confidante as well.

A great confidante is someone who doesn’t mix with you socially. They don’t know the people or situations about which you are emotionally processing.

The risk you run of choosing a confidante who is involved in your social scene, work environment or knows the people or situations you are processing is that they will betray your confidence.

The key to any communication with a confidante is to have the purpose of self-understanding from every connection with them.

Always set the intention to discover the higher learning from your experiences as this helps you grow your self-understanding at a great speed.

You receive gifts in every encounter and you release trapped emotion before it manifests as a tangible illness or disease.","Exercise: Have a confidante
The meaning of confidante is a person to whom secrets are confided or with whom private matters and problems are discussed.

A confidante is person who listens, asks probing questions, but does not try to fix your problem. When you have a true confidante to discuss your problems with, this will assist you to unravel the trapped emotions caught up in the drama of what’s happening.
",
TAoSH-15-8,15,"Don’t confuse empathy with sympathy!
According to the Oxford Dictionary sympathy means “Feelings of pity and sorrow for someone else’s misfortune”.

This is the difference between empathy and sympathy. When you empathise you feel what others are experiencing to the point of understanding their emotions in relation to their circumstance, but you don’t go down the rabbit hole of drama with them.

When you sympathise, not only do you understand the emotions, you personally experience it as you jump into the whirlpool with them and your energy spirals out of control like theirs. This doesn’t help you or them in a constructive way.

When you understand this distinction and focus on empathy rather than sympathy, the negative feelings associated with sympathy don’t happen.

It is also important to understand the impact of having too much empathy, or being a natural empath.","Exercise: How to handle too much empathy
There are many well-known ways of protecting your energy and handling your empath gift such as:

• A Prayer of Protection see page 27 for my prayer.

• White light yourself imagine you are surrounded by white light.

• Put yourself inside a protective box or cylinder – see page 25.

• Aromatherapy burning essential oils to cleanse the room and protect your energy; wear the oils on your body.

• Aura Soma is a form of colour healing therapy which works on the aura.

• Singing bowl use a singing bowl to transform the energy in your workplace, home and around you.",
TAoSH-16-8,16,"The Amnesia Line®
The Amnesia Line® is a concept that helps explain why things can go pear shaped in life and at other times everything flows. When you go below the line you forget all the resources you have to manage the bumpy ride called life.

When you are above the line you magically know what to do and when to do it making life feel easy and effortless. You seem to live with purpose, cope with disasters and have fun. ","Exercise: How To Stay Above The Amnesia Line®
• Whilst in a good space mentally, make a list of 10 things you love to do that make you happy, calm, peaceful, centered, rejuvenated, relaxed.

• Write the list on the back of an old business card and put it somewhere you will see it when you need it.

• Here’s my list:
1. Paint
2. Draw
3. Read trashy novels
4. Make sacred art from ripped paper
5. Go for a bush walk
6. Listen to music
7. Call a friend
8. Go to the movies
9. Re-arrange the furniture
10. Take photographs of flowers

You need to write these things down because when you go below the Amnesia Line® you forget all the amazing things you love to do that make you happy and help you cope with life.

You may need to do more than one activity to breakthrough and move back above the Amnesia Line®. The secret to getting back above the Amnesia Line® is to take action. Any action – you need to get the energy moving, so do something you know historically makes you happy.",
TAoSH-17-8,17,"Intuitive Healing 
If you WANT to successfully use intuitive healing in your life, you need to practice every day to keep your skills current. The interesting thing is – the more you practice, the more you will want to practice.

This is the first step to real change. Decide now whether you are going to do what it takes. Remember, just wanting something is not enough - you need to take ACTION.
","Exercise: Journal
Get a journal or a folder that can be used solely for your insight and intuitive healing development and record what you do, what you learn and what action you take. 

There are two reasons for this:

(a) you will have a record of your development – this is important because as you grow you will forget how you felt and what your ability was like in the beginning. If you fall into the “doubt cycle” you’ll forget how far you’ve come and your journal will act as your evidence

(b) you will be able to record your unique insights and what they mean for you. These insights will guide you to create and initiate self-healing templates unique for your situation",
TAoSH-18-8,18,"Practice Intuitive Exercises Daily
If you want to elevate your intuition you must practice. You need to train in the same way you would train for the Olympics. If you want exceptional intuition, you have to put in the work.

You don’t have to be an artist to draw or paint like the image in this card. This activity helps you to express yourself, not necessarily create pictures that amaze and astound people.

It is important to get both sides of your brain talking to each other. One way is left and right hand drawing and writing.","Exercise: Left Hand | Right Hand Drawing/Painting
This card is an example of this exercise. If you would like to know more about this process I recommend you read the book - ""The Power of Your Other Hand"" by Lucia Capacchione.

One of the exercises is to draw or paint a picture with your dominant hand and duplicate it with your non-dominant hand.

You may feel challenged by this exercise, yet I highly recommend you do it.

You can either draw or paint by copying something out of a book or from your phone; or you can use your imagination. Do the first image with your dominant hand and then replicate the image with your non-dominant hand.

It is a lot of fun and you can do it by yourself (retreat time); with friends; or with your children. You can paste the images into your journal and document your progress. Also make a note of any improvement in your intuition or brain working better.",
TAoSH-19-8,19,"Left-hand / Right-hand Writing
When you write or draw with your non-dominant hand the left brain or analytical aspect of self cannot make its presence felt. You are concentrating so intently on performing the next stroke of the pen, there is no space for the ego-mind chatter.

By doing this exercise you are building the bridge between your conscious and subconscious minds. This bridge is very helpful in triggering intuitive episodes.

Not only are you learning to tune into your subconscious mind, you are learning to tune into the collective consciousness where all answers reside.

When you practice this exercise you are 100% focused in the moment. And that is exactly what you want to be doing, training yourself to be 100% focused in the moment.

This exercise is also adapted from ""The Power of Your Other Hand"" by Lucia Capacchione.","Exercise: Left-hand / Right-hand Writing 
This is an extraordinary exercise for tapping into your subconscious and bringing the answers into the conscious domain that may otherwise remain hidden. The process for tapping into your subconscious by writing with both hands is:

• Think of a question whilst holding a coloured felt pen in your
dominant hand (the hand you normally write with).

• Write the question on a piece of paper.

• Hold a different coloured felt pen with your non-dominant hand and read the question again (either out loud or silently).

• Write the answer below the question.

This exercise works on many different levels and it is great to observe them all:

• You will notice that when the answer is more emotional it is more difficult to write legibly with your non-dominant hand.

• Your breathing will change rhythm when you are getting to the root of a problem. You may even develop a dry cough. This is a great signal to observe and use as a motivator to keep going.

• You may find when you are getting to the core of a problem you want to give up or distract yourself with an “urgent” task (this is called procrastination). Keep going as you’ll appreciate the result.

• You may notice you think you know what you’ll write with the non-dominant hand and the answer can be surprisingly different in a good way.",
TAoSH-20-8,20,"Ears
When there are problems with the ears this indicates not wanting to hear or being blocked from hearing something of importance.

Everyone can experience the download of information or understand what their resistance is to discovering an answer. Whether you hear with your physical ears or not does not change this process. Therefore, people who are deaf or hearing impaired are also able to participate and examine the symbolism and contemplate the question – “What is it I am not hearing?”","Exercise: Magnify Hearing
• Sit quietly in nature. Locate and isolate the individual sounds closest to you – listen for 2 minutes, become really familiar with them.

• Move your hearing focus out to about 50 meters (we’ll call this the middle distance) and locate and isolate the sounds at this distance for 2 minutes.

• Leave these sounds and move your hearing focus out to about 200 meters, locate and isolate the sounds coming from this far away for 2 minutes.

• Now open your awareness to all of the sounds simultaneously. This exercise will enhance your inner and outer hearing faculties.",
TAoSH-21-8,21,"Mirror Writing
This exercise was inspired by the book ""The Power of Your Other Hand"" by Lucia Capacchione. However, she didn't teach this method. 

Being a person with an Olympian mindset didn’t stop at doing the exercises from ""The Power of Your Other Hand"". When Mum told me she used to write to a pen pal in Europe using the mirror writing technique I was intrigued and immediately started practicing.

I enjoyed this process so much I began channeling poems and 365 quotes - one for each day of the year. You might like to do this exercise and write something you have always wanted to do.
","Exercise: Mirror Writing
Mirror writing is when you start writing on the right hand side of the page and flip each letter backwards. It takes a lot of concentration and your brain can't jump too far ahead with words because you are focusing on flipping each letter backwards to make your word. 

When you first start doing this exercise I recommend you have a little mirror on hand so you can check that you are flipping your letters correctly. They should look the correct way in the mirror when you look at what you have written.

This card shows you an example of mirror writing.

The writing on the right page is written from right to left by flipping the letters around. The writing on the left page is what you see in the mirror when you hold the page up to the mirror.

Try it! You may find it becomes one of your fun activities.",
TAoSH-22-8,22,"Teeth
We use our teeth to bite and chew. Sometimes we can feel we have bitten off more than we can chew. When there are problems with the teeth – look at how you manage the things you take on in your life.

If teeth problems show up unexpectedly review what you’ve been doing and you may find you’ve bitten off more than you are comfortable with. Focus on smaller elements of the bigger picture. This next exercise is a condensed version sourced from www.naturalnews.com.","Exercise: Oil Pulling
• On an empty stomach (best done first thing in the morning), put a dessertspoon of organic cold-pressed oil (coconut, olive, sesame or sunflower) into your mouth and swish and pull it through your teeth for 15-20 minutes.

• Do not swallow the oil. Spit it out (in the bin or outside). Brush your teeth with toothbrush #1 (no toothpaste).

• Rinse your mouth with salty water (use Himalayan rock or Celtic sea salt).

• Pull the salty water through your teeth.

• Brush your teeth with toothbrush #2 with natural toothpaste.",
TAoSH-23-8,23,"Patterned Water
In 1994, I went to Taiwan for a holiday and while there I was introduced to a man called “The Admiral”. He was an exceptional healer and Qi Gong Master. He was very generous with his time and shared profound wisdom with me. One of the things he demonstrated was the gift of patterning water.

He filled two clean glasses with tap water. I tasted the water in both glasses and they both tasted the same. He put one glass to the side, held the other glass in one hand and placed the other hand over the top of the glass. He closed his eyes and incanted 20 Buddha’s names in a particular order. (My understanding is that the Buddhist faith has Buddha’s similar to the saints in the Catholic Church.)

When he had finished he asked me to taste the water again. I was amazed to find it tasted like Chinese herbs. Yet the water was still clear and I knew he hadn’t added any powder or liquid to it. I felt immediately revitalised as if I had been given a potent tonic to drink. 

I didn’t learn the order of the Buddha’s names, but when I returned home to Australia, I wondered whether it was possible for me to pattern water like “The Admiral”. It is possible.","Exercise: Patterned Water
Put tap water into 2 glasses.
Taste both glasses of water. They should taste the same.

Put one glass aside and hold the other glass whilst doing this visualisation.

Imagine being in a room in another dimension. It looks like a herbalist’s cottage from ancient times. The walls are lined from floor to ceiling with shelves containing herbs in packets – some are powdered, others are the whole dried herb.

In the centre of the room is a timber table. It is a rustic room – no paint anywhere – just worn timber.

The glass of water is sitting on the timber table. Scan the room and you'll see some of the packets of herbs will glow. Take these packets of herbs out of the shelves and place them on the table. Open each packet and put some of the herb into the glass of water. Use your intuition - it might be a sprinkle to a pinch to a teaspoon. 

When all the herbs are in the glass of water, look behind you and you will notice a basket full of freshly cut flower heads, no stems. Choose a flower from the basket and place it on top of the glass of water.

There will be an alchemical flash of bright light and you will come all the way back into your body and into the room you are physically in. Taste the water from the glass you are holding and then taste the second glass that has been set aside. 

Do they taste different?

If they do, you have just patterned water for yourself that is going to help you heal. Experiment with this exercise. It is fun and you may enjoy drinking water you have patterned for yourself.",
TAoSH-24-8,24,"Lower Back
Generally, the lower back is about tension around finances. Questions to consider if your lower back is a problem for you are:

• Am I behaving responsibly with my finances?
• What am I afraid will happen?
• What am I doing to increase my financial security and do I believe it is possible?
• Am I taking responsibility for other people’s financial wellbeing?
• Do I have a savings plan?
• Do I have a budget?

Your answers to these questions will help you locate the emotional blockage causing the pain in the lower back.

Again, if it is on the left side look to the past and if it is the right side look to the present for the emotional block.

If it is the spine specifically look at the structure of how you manage your finances as the spine is about the structure of your life. ","Exercise: Pay Me First
If you haven’t already, start a “Pay Me First” account and put 10%
of what you earn into this account before you pay anyone else and
watch it grow. As your money grows you will gain a sense of financial
security and ease the tension in your lower back. 

If per chance, 10% is out of your depth, begin with 5%, 2% or 1%. The important thing is to start!",
TAoSH-25-8,25,"Arms | Hands
The arms and hands represent RECEIVING and invariably people who have a problem with this part of their body, struggle with receiving. They are genuinely nice, giving, caring people who would give you the shirt off their back if you needed it. However, when someone offers these people the shirt off their back (metaphorically speaking), this archetype generally says, “No thank you, I’m fine!” Or they find someone else to pass it forward to.

If you experience arm or hand problems practice receiving with gratitude. It may feel unfamiliar to you and you will resist doing it. This is why I suggest you PRACTICE, PRACTICE and more PRACTICE. You will break down your super neural highway of non-receiving and this can take some time if you do it on your own. Alternatively, you can find someone who specializes in this type of work to re-pattern your subconscious to receiving mode.

Underlying the pattern of not receiving with ease and grace are a plethora of limiting beliefs and it is those beliefs that need to be addressed either on your own, or with a practitioner skilled in this work.","Exercise: Receive
• When you are offered help, an item, a compliment, support with no strings – RECEIVE it gracefully. The secret is to receive without feeling any obligation to repay or give back to the person offering it.

• You can “pay it forward” as this movement keeps the energy of giving and receiving moving. Remember, you cannot give what you do not have! Be sure to fill your inner reservoir first before giving.",
TAoSH-26-8,26,"Neck
We use our neck to turn from side to side and see all opportunities on our path. When a problem with the neck shows up, this tells me a decision is about to be made and all the opportunities have not been considered.

Tension builds up as intuition suggests something important is missing. The left side of the neck indicates an opportunity with links to the past (more than 2 years back) and the right side of the neck indicates an opportunity with links from now back over the past 2 years.","Exercise: Release Neck Tension
• Place your chin on your chest and gently look left keeping your chin as close to your chest as possible and then look gently to your right.

• Slowly look to the left and right several times – keeping your chin as close as possible to your chest. Not only will you keep your neck more subtle, but you will also exercise the muscles going down under your shoulder blades. If this causes pain, don’t do it and see a practitioner of your choice. However, do consider opening up to further opportunities before making whatever decision is happening in your world right now.

• You can use the same technique as Exercise #9 too, page 58. Wrap your hands around your neck and consider opening up to seeing all your opportunities and say, “I can do that!” until your body believes you.

• If you are still in pain, consider what you are doing to block new opportunities from your path, put your hands on either side of your neck and say, “I don’t have to do that anymore!” until your body believes you.",
TAoSH-27-8,27,,"Exercise: Release Pain
• Review the decisions you have made recently. Are they in-line with your purpose? Do you feel in flow with these decisions? If no, where is the conflict? Change this part of your decision. Sometimes it only needs a tweak.

• Once you have identified the problem, put your best (the one that feels most comfortable) hand on the affected part of your body and say out loud, “I don’t have to do that anymore!” Repeat these words out loud until you really believe them. Energy will rush through your torso when your body believes you mean it.

• If the pain doesn’t completely leave your body, ask yourself what is it you are not doing for your purpose and need to be and say out loud, “I can do that!” Repeat these words out loud until you really believe them. Again, energy will rush through your torso when your body believes you mean it.

• Has the pain gone? If not, look deeper within to locate the precise action or thought triggering the pain.

• This technique works best on new pain problems. And you must honor the commitment you make with these words, otherwise the pain will return because you haven’t made the changes permanently.",

• Look into your eyes in your reflection and say out loud in reference to the worry: “I don’t have to do that anymore!”

• Repeat these words.

• Repeat again, this time really mean it and convince your reflection.

• Do you feel warmth flooding through your chest and then move through your body?

• If yes, go to the last step. If no, repeat the above step until you do.

• Wait two minutes and check in with yourself to see if your stress levels have dropped. What score do you give yourself now?

• If the score is higher than 5 place your hand on your thymus gland and ask yourself is there anything you could be doing you are not doing which is causing you stress.

TAoSH-30-8,30,"How to manage the expectations of others and yourself?

If you have a job that requires you to do tasks that you really don’t want to do (and they deflate your energy), you may need to find another job or do the tasks you are paid to do, but change the way you think and feel about them.

One way I am able to do this is to think of the jobs/tasks I don’t want to do, but really need to do, as an act of service and contemplate the Divine Being as I do them.

If you have children and/or pets you are responsible for, at times you will have to do things you don’t want to do.

Again I recommend you shift the focus from imposition to service.

However, if there are things you NEED to do because you are responsible for them and they are causing you to struggle emotionally, physically, mentally or spiritually, ask for help. But don’t be surprised when some people say “NO”.

It doesn’t mean you don’t deserve to get help. The people who say “NO” are looking after their balance of energy (whether this is being done consciously or unconsciously).

Keep asking till you find someone who has the capacity to help you.

Ask in a heart-felt, conscious way, not in a demanding, unconscious way. The outcome will always be more positive. Have you noticed how difficult people find it to ask for and accept help?","Exercise: Say “No”
• Say “NO” when you want to say “NO”.

• Although, in saying that, you will need to use some discernment in your job and your unique life responsibilities.",
TAoSH-31-8,31,"This template works particularly well if you have been in a negative environment and need to re-energise. It can help when you are feeling fatigued or drained by other people. When you sit in front of the computer for long periods of time this template helps, too.","Exercise: Sharing Nature’s Energy
You can quickly and easily re-energise yourself with this simple energy exchange.

• Find a tree, plant or grass that appears to be more vibrant and vital than the rest.

• If you are indoors, look out a window or use an indoor plant in your workplace or home.

• If you are outdoors, you have plenty of variety to choose from.

• To activate this template ask the tree or grass or indoor plant if you can share its energy.

• Imagine you can see/feel the energy field around the plant. You may even be able to see/feel the energy field with your eyes open. Tap into this field and use it to refill your depleted energy resources.

• Just as we have an energy field around our body, plants have this energy field around them and you can blend with it.

• As you take a deep breath in, imagine the shape of the infinity symbol dancing between you by visualising the light around the plant being drawn into your lungs with love.

• As you breathe out send this energy back to the plant with gratitude, completing the infinity symbol.

• Repeat this cycle for 3 minutes and feel your energy increase with each breath.

• Enjoy the experience of this much needed tonic.

Use a prayer like this one to activate energy sharing with your chosen tree, grass or indoor plant.

• A great way to help relieve the stress in your spine is to find the area of your life that requires structure and put it in place. It is amazing how fast the body will reflect the shifts you make energetically and emotionally.

TAoSH-33-8,33,"What is Spontaneous Visualisation?
“Spontaneous visualisation” is the type of visualisation that occurs during meditation or when you ponder (ie., think about) a question and a vision pops into your mind randomly. You don’t need to DO something to make it happen like when you access your memory and you have to consciously bring that memory into your mind to recall what happened.

With spontaneous visualisation, it just arrives in your mind’s eye in a similar way to when you watch a movie for the first time and you don’t know what comes next.","Exercise: Spontaneous Visualisation
• Close your eyes for a moment and imagine you are inside a shell. You have not experienced this before, so whatever comes up for you is spontaneous. You are not accessing a memory for the vision to manifest. This is spontaneous visualisation.",
TAoSH-34-8,34,"Consider viewing your strengths and weaknesses through a new lens. Instead of thinking the things you are good or excellent at as your strengths and the things that you are not so good at or simply cannot do as your weaknesses, consider that your strengths are the things you do that strengthen your energy and the things that weaken your energy are your weaknesses.","Exercise: Strengths and Weaknesses
• Take a notebook around with you for a week – it doesn’t need to have red and green on the cover (but it may help). Write down all the things you do that uplift at the front of the notebook and all the things that deflate your energy at the back of the book. At the end of the week review your findings. Once you know what your true strengths and weaknesses are, make plans to outsource your weaknesses and magnify your strengths. This may not happen overnight, however, to live your authentic life you have to start somewhere so it may as well be here.

• Get yourself an accountability buddy who will support you to create these shifts in your life.

NOTE: This exercise does not mean you leave your job, struggle financially and create unnecessary hardship. This is an invitation to observe your strengths and weaknesses, understand yourself more and plan the transformation of your life by managing your energy better. It may even create an opportunity for your job description to be restructured so your strengths benefit your business or your employer’s business.",
TAoSH-35-8,35,"Technology Free Time
In the beginning, you miss the adrenalin that comes from the immediacy of this form of communication, but after a while you find you don’t miss it at all. Being uncontactable on the cyber grid means you can be fully present in whatever activity or relationship you are engaged in physically.","Exercise: Technology Free Time
Turn of your technology for a reset retreat for 24 hours or more.

Being plugged in 24/7 doesn’t give you any downtime. The reality is you are always available and constantly on high alert. The fight or flight mechanism is being abused by being so accessible night and day.

The world doesn’t fall apart if you go off “the technology grid”. In fact, when you plug back in you may find your cyber community is more connected with you because they’ve missed you.

If you opt-out of the “technology grid” for 1 day per week – you will feel like you have had a holiday. The impact on your ability to rejuvenate your energy levels will be so great you will want to do it more often. If you can’t opt-out 1 day per week, it is crucial for your long term well-being to opt-out 1 day per month.",

You can grow this intuitive skill. Every time the phone rings tune into whom the caller may be. The secret  is to reflect on the previous few minutes and recall who floated through your mind. The person ringing more often than not subtly touched your mind in that time with their thoughts.

• Come to a stream with 7 stepping stones – step onto the first stepping stone and a red light shines up – and then the next. Each stone has a different colour – orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, violet.

• Step onto the other side of the bank. In front of you is a magnificent door. Walk up to the door – put your hands on the door and keep pushing as your body follows your ends straight through the door into a meeting room.

• There is a table with chairs – nothing else - a door to the right and a door to the left.

• In front of you is your big chair with buttons on the arm rest – press one of the buttons to open the right hand door and invite the people who will be interviewing you or whom you want a meeting with into the room.

• Ask them to sit down and you interview them. Find out what they want from you to make you an ideal person for the job or whatever you are doing this template for.

• When you are finished asking them questions and interacting with them – thank them for their time and press a button on the left arm of your chair and they leave via the left door.

• You turn around and leave the way you came through the door behind you, go back across the stepping stones and as you step on each stone the colour recedes back into the stone.

• Step onto the bank and walk to the stairs and back along the path, and come all the way back into the room and into your body.

• Become fully present in your body, filling your bones, muscles, organs, bloodstream with the essence of you.

TAoSH-40-8,40,,"Exercise: Write a letter
This is an incredibly powerful exercise which I feel is a forgotten healing art. Write a letter to the person whose words or actions have initiated your emotional turmoil. Let it all flow out of you as fast as you can write it.

NOTE: Handwrite the letter rather than type it because handwriting accesses a different part of your brain and you connect with your emotions better. It may take longer to write, but it is worth it. Make the letter as long as there is flow; keep writing until there is no residue of emotion left around this situation. The true blessing from this process is to end the letter with your learnings.

NO! You are not going to post it, as much as you may want to. Instead you are going to have a burning ceremony. This is a powerful emotional cleanse.

Build a small fire, either inside or outside and make a ceremony out of the process. You can have candles, incense, singing bowl, bells or gong or anything you have on hand. Have a pre-written prayer or allow free thought to flow through you as you set the intention to release all the emotion to the universe.

This is a sacred act for you, not a punishing act about or against another. You are doing this to be relieved of destructive trapped emotion that will not serve your holistic wellbeing.",

TAoSH-43-8,43,,"Template: Alimentary Canal Healing
This process lines the inside of the alimentary canal with a sheath.

Imagine you have the beginning of the sheath in your mouth. It looks like a clear plastic skin and it begins to unravel in your mouth and lines the entire canal from the mouth, down the oesophagus, balloons out to line the stomach, down into the duodenum and continues through the small intestine, into the large intestine and through to the anus.

Once you have done this, imagine you have a huge bucket of white cream. You need to cover the entire sheath you have placed in your alimentary canal with this cream. It is similar to icing a cake with a layer of icing.

The next step is to bring another layer through the canal. It is almost like sausage skin. Take that from mouth to anus and you can do this quite quickly as the dimension you are working in to do these visualisations doesn’t have the constraints of our physical reality. You can warp speed your visualisations.

What you have ended up with now is skin, cream, skin. 

Continue this process until you have 10-20 layers. I’m not going to give you a definite number here – you need to feel into this intuitively and determine what would be best for you and your current situation.

Once you have visualised as many layers as you intuitively feel is needed – flood the entire alimentary canal with emerald green light. Track the light from the mouth, down the oesophagus, into the stomach, through the small and large intestine and out the back passage.

When this is complete – repeat the process with bright white light – and when you reach the anus there will be what feels or looks like an explosion of bright light. Take a deep breath in. As you gently release the breath come all the way through the light back into your body and into the room.

This technique is not a once off template. If you have an alimentary problem, I recommend you repeat this process daily until you scan your entire alimentary canal and you see and feel it as being a healthy system.",

TAoSH-45-8,45,This template came about after I heard a story about a man who said he healed a burn he received from a burst radiator on his car. He didn’t share how he healed the burn. I figured out another way after getting an oil burn.,"Template: Burn healing
Sit quietly, close your eyes and place your hand over the burn. Take a deep breath in and as you gently release the breath imagine you can see the burn from the inside.

Flood it with royal blue light as it acts as an anaesthetic.

Imagine you are looking at a transverse section of the burn. You will see where the burn has affected the skin and gradually recedes to healthy skin.

Now imagine a roll of plastic wrap - this is new human skin. Pull a sheet of plastic wrap skin from the roll and lay it under the burn in the good skin area.

Now add a layer of white cream – completely covering the new skin. And then added another layer of skin over the white cream. In a manner similar to making lasagne. The burn would have looked like a crater in the transverse image. 

Continue with the layers until the crater is filled – it will take approximately 40 layers.

Flood the layers from the top to the bottom with emerald green light. I use emerald green light because it sets the intention for healing. After this, flood the vision with bright white light to complete the healing. As it reaches the bottom of the crater there will be an enormous alchemical flash and the healing is complete. Using the flash as a catalyst, the essence of you travels back into your body.

By the time you finish this process, the redness which spread out around the burn will disappear and the intense pain should be gone. However, there will still be a red mark where it was severely burnt which may not blister after this technique.

Within half an hour, you will most likely have forgotten about the burn. Interestingly, within 24 hours the burn area will most likely change to a deep burgundy colour. Within a couple of days this will probably disappear; you'll forget about the burn and approximately two weeks later, the skin will peel like sunburn where the major burn had been. 

There should be no scar or evidence of a burn.",

Make yourself comfortable, you can be sitting or lying down. Take 3 deep breaths in and then breathe normally again. Now travel inside your shoulder socket via your screen of mind. The ball and the socket look something like a cup. As you travel inside your shoulder keep an eye out for gravel or sand or maybe lumps on the socket or the ball.

If you find sand or gravel, imagine you can vacuum up any loose material with the universal vacuum cleaner which spontaneously appears in your visualisation. After you’ve done this, imagine you have some fine sandpaper and sand all the rough areas until they are smooth.

When everything feels smooth, that is no lumps or restriction of any sort, imagine you have an Aladdin’s lamp filled with golden healing oil. It has a magnificent texture and actually oozes a little bit when you pour it out onto a very soft cloth.

Use this oily cloth to polish everything in your vision ie., the shoulder ball, the socket and surrounding area. 

Once you have polished everything, infuse the whole vision with emerald green light to set the healing and finish with a bright white light. Wait for the alchemical flash and come back into your body. Take a deep breath and gently release. Open your eyes when you are ready.

Move your shoulder around. How does it feel? Hopefully it feels amazing and moves freely. If not, repeat the process.",
TAoSH-48-8,48,"When you connect intuitively, energetically or psychically with someone you create a strong energy bond. This bond is a deeper connection than every day interactions with others.

I refer to these bonds as psychic cords and if you do not deliberately cut these psychic cords, you are bound to that person in a way that can establish a psychic drain on your energy. Without proper management, the energy needs of the person you work with will determine how much of a drain they are on you.

If the person you connect with is sick, they are energetically seeking any means of re-energising themselves they can. Energy cords are one of the first ways they do this.

In saying that it sounds like this is a malicious and reprehensible act. Most of the time this is done unconsciously and is a primal act of survival. Most people would be mortified to know they are doing it.","Template: Cut Energy Cords
By being responsible and deliberately cutting the cords after every psychic/intuitive connection, your energy levels will stay stronger.

I hear you saying “I don’t have time!” That’s not true!

When you go to bed at night make it the last thing you do before falling to sleep. You can do it in 1-2 minutes. See Personal Cleansing template on page 18.

TAoSH-49-8,49,,"Template: DNA Codon Activation
• Step into your sacred creation temple. On your screen of mind imagine a double helix DNA strand. Inside the strand is a lift. Step inside the lift and press level 21. You will start this template with the presumption your 20 codons of normal DNA are switched on.

• Watch the buttons on the lift as you shoot up to level 21. As you go past each level the lift button should light up. Take note if any button does not light up. You will go back and fix this later.

• When you get to level 21, the doors open and you see a concrete ledge with a pipe at eye height. This pipe represents your codon. If there is a button/plug pushed into the pipe, this codon is switched off. Take the button/plug out of the pipe and put it on the ledge at your feet – this turns the codon on and allows the energy to flow.

• Take a deep breath in and feel what happens in your physical body. You may feel energy activate somewhere. This is a spontaneous experience and not one to fake or copy.

• Step back into the lift and press level 22. Repeat the process as above.

• Repeat for Level 23 and Level 24.

• Step back into the lift. If you had any buttons between G-20 which didn’t light up on the journey up to Level 21, go back and check to see if the button/plug is pushed in or out. Pull it out and put it on the ledge if you need to.

• Once all levels have the button/plug pulled out – go back to Level 24 and press G. As the lift goes down to Ground emerald green light
shines out of each lift button as you pass that floor.

• When you get to Ground, the doors open and bright white light rushes into the lift. Step into the light and hear the doors close behind you. The lift shoots back up to Level 24 taking the bright white light to each level setting the DNA activation.

• You keep walking through the light, back into your physical body and into the room where you started. Come all the way back into your body and if you need to ground yourself, place the palm of your hand over your crown chakra at the top of your head for a few minutes.

Repeat this template each day until you have 24 codons switched on 5 days in a row. Once this happens the DNA Activation has become stable. Then you can check the codons once a week for 4 weeks. If they remain stable at 24 codons switched on - you can then check in once per month.

This template is for the lymphatic system and reducing fluid retention in the body. I use what I call my “Dr Shivago syringe” and it looks a little like this.

Many years ago I was asked if I would come to see a friend of a friend. This person was overcoming major surgery. When I saw this person, I was concerned for their wellbeing. I couldn’t see the outline of any bones in their feet. They looked like big fat sausages on the ends of legs. I was stunned to see how swollen they were.

I asked them to do the above template and they removed all the fluid into the syringes. This took a few minutes and then we started talking about something else.

Within 15 minutes their feet and hands looked normal, I could see all of the bones. It was a remarkable phenomenon to witness.

When something like this happens it feels like a miracle, but basically what you have done is shown the body how to remove the fluid.","Template: Fluid retention
Place your hand over the area with the fluid retention. Imagine you have a huge syringe and place it in the area where the lymphatic system is blocked or where there is swelling. Usually this is in the feet, ankles or underarm.

Remove the syringe and place it into a black box beside you.

Imagine inserting another syringe and repeat the process. Keep repeating the process until you are unable to draw fluid into the cylinder. Close the lid on the black box. The universe knows what to do with this waste.

Your task is to imagine the hoop slowly passing over the body. If there is an area of the body which needs a lot of healing work, the hoop will move very slowly – and there will be a lot of colour activity. 

Sometimes it doesn’t seem to be moving at all – just wait – when the healing is complete the hoop will start moving again.

This is not a process you can rush. The timing will be as it needs to go.

It may take 10 minutes to half an hour in human time; or it may only take 2 minutes. There is no timeline. Simply as little or as much time as needed.

Sometimes you’ll notice there are parts of the body the hoop skims over quite quickly. This means you don’t need healing in this part of the body.

Allow the hoop to travel from head to toe as slow or fast as it needs to go and in whatever colour spontaneously shows up.

When the hoop has completely traversed the body, go back to the beginning and instruct the hoop to pass over the body again. If all the healing has been done, the hoop glides smoothly over the body. If there is more healing to be done, the hoop takes its time again.

The whole purpose of this template is to get your body to the point where the hoop glides over it from head to toe very smoothly. And this is your signal that the tune up has been completed.",
TAoSH-54-8,54,,"Template: Gallstones Remedy
Make a mixture of 1/2 cold pressed extra virgin olive oil + 1/2 fresh lemon juice.

• This mixture tastes like a delicious salad dressing.

• Make small amounts – the most I would mix at any one time would be 1/8 cup of oil + 1/8 cup of lemon juice.

Take 1 dessertspoon 4 times a day – a dessertspoon at breakfast / lunch / dinner and before bed and be sure to take it with food.

Take this mixture for 14-21 days. And from between days 14-21 you should pass the gallstones through your bowels.

(Keep the mixture in the refrigerator – the older it becomes the thicker/creamier it will be – this is still fine to drink. It just doesn’t look so palatable.)

Hold your hands under cool running water for a couple of minutes and consciously ask that your energy body be cleared of all vibration that is not for your highest good. This is particularly important when you are doing hands on energy work.

However, I find this ritual very beneficial after all psychic or intuitive contact. ",
TAoSH-56-8,56,"Firstly, if your core body temperature goes lower than normal – and this can happen if the early morning cools down and you don’t have enough bed covers. You need to warm up your core body temperature quickly. One of the best ways to do this is to wrap a thin blanket around your abdomen or use a (covered) hot water bottle on your abdomen.

It may also be that you have inadvertently eaten gluten and you are having a reaction to the gluten as it hits your lower bowel. Gluten can take hours to many hours to reach this part of your bowel.

If you don’t monitor your gluten intake, I recommend you trial eliminating gluten from your diet for at least one month to see what impact it has on your overall wellbeing – and particularly on your IBS.

Another problem for IBS sufferers is they can have too much roughage eg., from nuts. Dukkah – an Egyptian nut and spice mix can also trigger bowel spasms. Really it is a matter of observing how your body responds to foods.

Whatever the cause, you need a swift natural process for relieving the spasms.","Template: IBS Spasm Healing
The colour blue can be used to soothe the body. It has an anaesthetic quality which is very calming. The particular vibration of blue to use in this healing template is the blue of the midday sky in summer. It is a rich vital and vivid azure blue.

To do this process, be associated in your body. Imagine you have an azure blue ball of light about the size of a golf ball and place it inside your mouth.

Swallow it.

From inside, track the ball of blue light as it goes down your oesophagus into your stomach, circulate it around the entire circumference of your stomach, into the duodenum, down into the small intestines and then into the large intestines (bowel) and out the back passage.

Sound simple?

When you are not doubled over in pain and you can barely breathe – yes, it’s very simple. However, when you are in pain, it can be a challenge to complete the process in one go.

The secret to this technique being effective is you must stay 100% focused on the journey of the blue ball of light all the way from the mouth to the anus.

If you get distracted by the pain, an outside thought or another vision other than the one I’ve described to you – YOU MUST return to the beginning of the template and start again.

You will need to practice this template regularly as it is the discipline your body will respond to as well as the colour. Your bowel will naturally relax when you initiate this healing template.

In most cases, with practice you will be able to stop the spasms within 1-2 minutes or in a severe case within 5 minutes of using this template – particularly if you use the blanket or warm scarf around the abdomen as well. An added bonus is to release the gas from your bowel too.

However, this is not always possible unless you can train your bowel to relax using the above template or something else that has a similar effect.",

With this template you program your immune system to keep anything that is not for your highest good out of your blood stream. 

Use this template anytime you are concerned about having an infection or being vulnerable to infection – particularly if you need to stay in hospital for any reason.

Imagine or feel the essence of you travel from your lungs into the blood vessel that takes the oxygen filled blood from your lungs to your heart.

It should feel or look like you are in a tunnel that has a red liquid flowing through it. As you become sensitive to the change in light you may notice that you can actually see or feel the different cells in the blood.

Imagine or feel a gold panning sieve being placed in this tunnel. This is a magic sieve and will only allow through the mesh, cells and nutrients which help you stay healthy and safe. The mesh catches anything that could harm you.

Say this prayer to activate the magic sieve:

“Beloved guardians of the sieve please activate the miracle of this sieve and only allow the cells and nutrients that will help keep me healthy and safe to pass through your wire mesh. I ask that this activation stay in place as long as my body needs it. Amen”.

If you are using this template to prevent against infection you can stop here.

However, if you have an infection you will see or feel the sieve filling with all the things that are not serving your wellbeing. There isn’t a particular way this will look. It will be unique in each circumstance.

When the sieve is almost full, place another sieve behind it, remove the full sieve from your tunnel and place it into a black box. From here, it will be safely disposed of by the Universe.

The activation prayer takes care of everything for you.

When the sieve is no longer being filled with infection, feel yourself being gently drawn into the bright Divine Light, come all the way back into the room and into your body.",

TAoSH-60-8,60,"Master Cells in the Body
I wondered if Master Cells (“MC’s”) existed could they be in charge of the division process within their own sub-group?

And if you could heal each “MC”, could you conceivably heal your body working with a small number of cells.

These questions intrigued me, particularly as I was creating illness within my own body which I wanted to heal. With curiosity, I meditated with these questions in mind and experienced the following technique which has been successfully duplicated by many people.

In a vision, I was shown there are 10 MC’s within the human body and the following process could be used to heal them. I’ve recently wondered whether these Master Cells are part of the stem cell system. It’s an interesting consideration.

When I received these instructions to heal the MC’s, I was very unwell and only 2 out of 10 cells appeared perfectly round. Over the years, this number has varied on each inspection.

We live in a stressful time and it is not enough to do this treatment just the once. Stress impacts us energetically every day and it is wise to check your 10 MC’s at least once a month – preferably once a week – to make sure they are all perfectly round.","Template: Master Cell Healing
• Be seated in a comfortable position (on a cushion, meditation stool or chair).

• Take a deep breath in through the base chakra drawing that breath all the way up through the chakras to the top of your shoulders. Hold it for the count of 5 and gently release the breath, letting go of all negativity and thoughts of the day – repeat 2 more times.

• Breathing normally, imagine you are walking along a pathway and come to a set of stairs. There are seven steps before you and as you walk down each step a colour shoots up and surrounds you. Breathe in this colour all the way to the bottom of your lungs and gently release all the way out before stepping down onto the next step. The colours of the steps are as follows:

RED
ORANGE
YELLOW
GREEN
BLUE
PURPLE
VIOLET

• At the bottom of the steps is a beautiful golden doorway with an ornate handle. Put your hand on the handle and open the door to find an incredible bright golden light that shines out to meet you. Step into this light, breathing it all the way into your lungs and releasing any last residue of negativity and the outside world as you continue walking through the golden light.

• After taking 7 steps, you step into a room that you can decorate creatively and spontaneously as you want. However, there is one item that is required in this room. A very large screen.

• Through creative and spontaneous visualisation you will heal your “10 MC’s”. Remember creative visualisation is where you manipulate the image before your mind’s eye. Spontaneous visualisation is where an image appears in your mind’s eye without conscious thought (a bit of a surprise really!).

• Instruct your “1st MC” to appear on your screen (because you have given this instruction you are to wait for it to arrive spontaneously).

Inspect the cell - if it is not perfectly round, make it round using creative visualisation. You can be as outrageous and adventurous as you want in this process to keep your cell perfectly round. There are no boundaries or limits in this dimension. On my first visit I used building scaffolding to hold my changes in place. Another time, I popped a road pipe inside the cell to keep it round.

• Instruct your “2nd MC” to appear on your screen. Repeat as for “1st MC”. Repeat the process above until you have reviewed your “10 MC’s” and are confident they are all perfectly round.

Now, for the most important part:

• Look at your “10 MC’s” on your viewing screen and creatively see a small candle flame flickering in the centre of each cell. Focus intently on this flame and watch it grow larger and brighter the more you focus, until the entire cell is filled completely with the flame.

• When this occurs within all of them, the cells disappear from the screen in a flash of bright light leaving the screen blank. The healing is now being done.

• Find the doorway you came in through at the beginning of your treatment. Open the door and step back into the bright golden light, breathe it all the way into your lungs and all the way out - completing
the healing process. Take 7 steps through the bright golden light onto the stairs with the coloured lights shining up from each step.

• Walk slowly up the stairs, with each step that you take the colour recedes back into the step, starting with violet through to red:

VIOLET
PURPLE
BLUE
GREEN
YELLOW
ORANGE
RED

• You are all the way back now on the pathway where you began. Take a deep breath in and gently release as you come all the way back into your body. Move your hands and feet and open your eyes when you are ready.

• Imagine you are walking along a dirt path in the country.

• You are dissociated from the image of you (this means a part of you is watching the rest of you walking along the path).

• As you look closely you will notice that there are threads and ribbons; maybe even young trees or mature trees attached to your body (these are connections made with people throughout the day – and can be represented here as anything that comes to mind).

• Every thought or physical interaction with another person makes a connection to your energy bodies.

• For the deepest rejuvenating and regenerating healing to occur during sleep – it is useful to remove all connections to your energy bodies.

• Remove the threads, ribbons, trees – whatever you see or feel is connected to you.

• Cut them, pull them out, burn them – do what intuitively comes to you.

• Continue walking along the path, you will notice that the image of you is starting to fade – this is good.

• You also notice that the connections are becoming more subtle – remove these subtle connections, too.

• When you are almost completely faded associate back into the subtle form, lift your eyes and look into the distance, you will see a tunnel filled with golden light.

• Your almost faded body is pulled quickly into the light and this is where you will rest and rejuvenate.

• Your energy body completely dissolves in this golden light.

• distance healing
• medical intuition scans
• going into crowded areas, for example:
- concerts
- cinemas
- shopping malls

Also activate it when you are receiving healing or therapies, particularly if you are an empath and sensitive to other people’s energy. You would do this in circumstances such as:

Observe your body walking along a dirt track in the bush. There is grass growing between the wheel tracks. Observe ribbons, threads, trees and cables that are attached to your body floating out of your vision to whomever they were connected to.

It was not relevant who the connections are with. Cut, burn, disconnect, or pull them all out. As you continue to walk along the path the body became more subtle, and you'll see the more subtle connections to this body. So these are removed and the body becomes more subtle you will see more subtle connections.

Once you have observed the seven bodies have released these connections a faint outline of light will remain in your vision. Your dissociated self will re-merge with your subtle bodies and be drawn into the light.

In this bright light, there is no perception of being solid or separate. The bright light is the Chamber of Rejuvenation. In this chamber your  physical body will gradually strengthen and feel restored energetically.

When you are ready move through to the other side of the chamber. It is like stepping through an invisible wall. From one moment to the next you will go from bright Light into an incredible green field with a gentle rise to the right.

TAoSH-64-8,64,"The key to this template, you must honour the commitment you have just made to yourself. If you don’t honour your promise, the pain comes back.

It’s not that the template doesn’t work, you have forgotten your agreement which says you have a pattern of doing this and it may take some relapses to magnify the pattern enough for you to stop it altogether.

And that’s not a bad thing. It simply means you need to repeat the process. Really mean it and honour it. There is another possibility this template won’t work and that is you haven’t identified the root decision you made to create the pain. Go back through your memory and find another decision you’ve made around responsibility that doesn’t sit well with you.","Template: Shoulder Pain Release
PHASE 1
For your shoulder to be relieved of pain quickly place your opposite hand on your shoulder where it is sore. If this is not possible get as close as you can to it.

Search back through your memories and locate the decision you made around responsibility that didn't belong to you. Now say out loud:

“I don’t have to do that anymore!”

And again.

“I don’t have to do that anymore!”

And again and really convince someone that you mean it.

“I don’t have to do that anymore!”

If you don’t get a tingling feeling or a body sign letting you know those words are true, this technique hasn’t worked. So dig deeper and keep saying the words till you get the feeling that you really believe what you’re saying.

Sometimes, it can take 6, 8 – 10 times. The amount of repetitions is not important. Repeat the words until you get the validation.

PHASE 2
There is another side to the coin. For every yin there is a yang. The other scenario is you stepping up and taking action.

Ask yourself – “What is it that I want to do and I’m not yet doing?”
Locate that “thing” and place your hand on the part of your body that’s in pain and say out loud:

“I can do that!”

And again!

“I can do that!”

And again – and really mean it. You either have to convince yourself or another person in the room.

“I can do that!”

It is the same scenario as above. If after 3 times the pain is still there keep going till you get the validation via a body sign that you believe what you are saying. The pain will leave your body.",

Behind your top front teeth you will find a ridge.

both sides of your top front teeth.

Place the tip of your tongue in this “sweet” spot – it will tickle slightly
when you have your tongue in the right spot and you may even feel a connection to your solar plexus (belly button).

Either muscle test yourself or get someone to muscle test you while you are thinking about an unpleasant event. It seems to be more dramatic and validating when you have someone else muscle test you.

STEP 1: Think of an unpleasant event, make sure you DON’T have the tip of your tongue to the “sweet” spot in the roof of your mouth. Muscle test. You will find it very difficult to resist the pressure.

STEP 2: Now, think of that unpleasant event again and this time put the tip of your tongue to the “sweet” spot in the roof of your mouth. You should be able to resist the pressure of the muscle testing.

If you can’t resist the test with your tongue in the “sweet” spot, you don’t have your tongue in the correct position.

So experiment until you can think of the unpleasant event and resist the pressure of the muscle testing. This way you will know you have located the correct position for your tongue.
